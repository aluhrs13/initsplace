# In Its Place
You probably have a lot of stuff. Sometimes stuff gets stolen or a fire happens and you need to prove to your insurance that you had some amount of stuff worth some amount of money, and it's really hard to remember what stuff you had and how much it was worth. Or maybe you're really forgetful and can't remember where you put some stuff and now you can't find it. Or maybe you have a storage unit somewhere and you think you put some stuff in it, but aren't 100% sure and don't want to drive to it to find out.

For whatever reason you want to know what things are in what places, In Its Place is there to track those things and places. Could probably also be used to track more than stuff in places, the sky is the limit.

# Setup
In Its Place is still in super early development, it's basically a lightweight UI on-top of a few database tables, so I don't have a real guide for setting it up. I'm planning on building a docker container for easy install and updates once it's usable.

# Building
Front-end is React JS, back-end is ASP.NET Core, database is Postgres.

# Contributions
I'm open to it, but open an issue with the idea before writing code please.
